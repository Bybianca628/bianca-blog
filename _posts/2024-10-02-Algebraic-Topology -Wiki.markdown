This semester I took a position of TA in my advisor's class, "intro to algebraic topology". Both me and my advisor dislike the idea of exams, so we decided to follow another path of examination. After some conversation, we concluded that there are two abilitties that are very important to any mathematician: the abilitty to write good mathematical texts in LaTeX, and collaborating with eachother. So we concluded that a making them work, toghether in a mathematical book/site would constitue a  good form of examination. Thats how the Algebraic Topology Wiki project...
