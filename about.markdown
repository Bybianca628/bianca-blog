My name is Bianca Carvalho de Oliveira and I'm a master student currently studying rational homotopy theory. Some of my other research interests include higher category theory and abstract homotopy theory. This page serves as a hub for my project and as a mean of having important information about myself organized and easily acessible to anyone interested.
